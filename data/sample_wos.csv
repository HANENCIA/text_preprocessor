2018,[INVITED] Computational intelligence for smart laser materials processing,"Casalino, G","Computational intelligence (CI) involves using a computer algorithm to capture hidden knowledge from data and to use them for training ""intelligent machine"" to make complex decisions without human intervention. As simulation is becoming more prevalent from design and planning to manufacturing and operations, laser material processing can also benefit from computer generating knowledge through soft computing. This work is a review of the state-of-the-art on the methodology and applications of CI in laser materials processing (LMP), which is nowadays receiving increasing interest from world class manufacturers and 4.0 industry. The focus is on the methods that have been proven effective and robust in solving several problems in welding, cutting, drilling, surface treating and additive manufacturing using the laser beam. After a basic description of the most common computational intelligences employed in manufacturing, four sections, namely, laser joining, machining, surface, and additive covered the most recent applications in the already extensive literature regarding the CI in LMP. Eventually, emerging trends and future challenges were identified and discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
2018,<< INDUSTRY 4.0 >> AS A MECHANISM FOR FORMING << SMART PRODUCTION >>,"Sergeyeva, OY","<< Smart production >> is a new model of industrial development of the 21st century on the basis of digital technologies, which already to some extent operates in the form of a production system that creates products and services on non markets, contributing to the improvement of a comfortable life of the person, the population. Active development in the 21st century of information technologies and concepts contributed to the creation and development of cyberphysical systems that integrate computing resources into physical processes. Digitalisation and its transformation in manufacturing brings new features and high technology sectors, such as construction, oil service, energy, space, health, etc. Index of Russian digitization of international research for 2016 amounted to 113 points. Little use of the potential of digital transformation of industries has become the main problem of the country. The state concept of social and economic development of the Russian Federation involves the development of competitive industry in Russia and effective technology platforms, improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the Russian economy through the development of high-tech industry on the basis of the basic concept of << industry 4.0 >> through its digitalization and restructuring, using innovative tools and mechanisms. The use of artificial intelligence systems in production processes will radically change the production, the basic basis of which will be additive 3D technologies. Additive technologies are a process of layer-by-layer expansion and synthesis of the object using computer 3D-technologies. In modern production it is a set of different processes, including UV-irradiation, extrusion, jet spraying, fusion, lamination. Modern production technologies contribute to the development of new markets and are the driving force of the digital revolution."
2018,2016 New Horizons Lecture: Beyond Imaging-Radiology of Tomorrow,"Hricak, H","This article is based on the New Horizons lecture delivered at the 2016 Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting. It addresses looming changes for radiology, many of which stem from the disruptive effects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This is an emerging era of unprecedented rapid innovation marked by the integration of diverse disciplines and technologies, including data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence-technologies that narrow the gap between man and machine. Technologic advances and the convergence of life sciences, physical sciences, and bioengineering are creating extraordinary opportunities in diagnostic radiology, image-guided therapy, targeted radionuclide therapy, and radiology informatics, including radiologic image analysis.

2018,5G-Smart Diabetes: Toward Personalized Diabetes Diagnosis with Healthcare Big Data Clouds,"Chen, M; Yang, J; Zhou, JH; Hao, YX; Zhang, J; Youn, CH","Recent advances in wireless networking and big data technologies, such as 5G networks, medical big data analytics, and the Internet of Things, along with recent developments in wearable computing and artificial intelligence, are enabling the development and implementation of innovative diabetes monitoring systems and applications. Due to the life-long and systematic harm suffered by diabetes patients, it is critical to design effective methods for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Based on our comprehensive investigation, this article classifies those methods into Diabetes 1.0 and Diabetes 2.0, which exhibit deficiencies in terms of networking and intelligence. Thus, our goal is to design a sustainable, cost-effective, and intelligent diabetes diagnosis solution with personalized treatment. In this article, we first propose the 5G-Smart Diabetes system, which combines the state-of-the-art technologies such as wearable 2.0, machine learning, and big data to generate comprehensive sensing and analysis for patients suffering from diabetes. Then we present the data sharing mechanism and personalized data analysis model for 5G-Smart Diabetes. Finally, we build a 5G-Smart Diabetes testbed that includes smart clothing, smartphone, and big data clouds. The experimental results show that our system can effectively provide personalized diagnosis and treatment suggestions to patients."
2018,A 0.55 V 1.1 mW Artificial Intelligence Processor With On-Chip PVT Compensation for Autonomous Mobile Robots,"Kim, Y; Shin, D; Lee, J; Lee, Y; Yoo, HJ","Autonomous mobile robots are receiving a lot of attention for many applications, such as package delivery and smart surveillance, however, the battery capacity is limited to implement intelligent decision making in robots because of the heavy computational costs. In this paper, an ultra-low-power artificial intelligence processor (AIP) is proposed for real-time decision making of autonomous mobile robots. To achieve low power consumption while maintaining high performance, it adopts four key features: 1) an 8-thread tree search processor for real-time path planning; 2) a reinforcement learning accelerator for the avoidance of unexpected obstacles; 3) a 3-level transposition table cache for the reduction of duplicated computations; and 4) a PVT compensation circuit for the stable operation at near-threshold voltage. The proposed 16 mm(2) AIP is fabricated using 65-nm triple-well CMOS technology. It consumes only 1.1 mW at 0.55 V supply voltage and 7 MHz operating frequency, and 151 mW at 1.2 V supply voltage and 245 MHz operating frequency. The AIP achieves fast search speed (470 000 search/s) and low energy consumption (79 nJ/search), and it is successfully applied to a battery-powered robot system for autonomous navigation without any collision in dynamic indoor environments."
2018,A Benchmarking Framework for Control Methods of Maritime Cranes Based on the Functional Mockup Interface,"Sanfilippo, F; Hatledal, LI; Pettersen, KY; Zhang, HX","Abenchmark framework for advanced controlmethods of maritime cranes is presented based on the use of the functional mockup interface. The system integrates different manipulator models, all the corresponding hydraulic systems, various vessels, and the surrounding environment for visualization. Different control methods can be transparently implemented and tested. A set of routine tests, different cost functions, and metrics are provided-taking into account several factors, including position accuracy, energy consumption, quality, and safety for both the cranes and the surrounding environment. The concept of operational profiles is introduced, allowing for definition of different standard transporting and lifting operations. By considering task-oriented routines, this benchmark suite allows the comparison of different control methods independently from the specific crane model to be controlled. Two alternative control methods for maritime cranes based on the use of artificial intelligence are extensively compared. The first method is based on the use of genetic algorithms, while the second method involves the use of particle swarm optimization. Simulation results are presented for both methods."
2018,A bio-inspired tool for managing resilience in enterprise networks with embedded intelligent formulation,"Habib, SJ; Marimuthu, PN","The bio-organisms are resilient in nature, where resilience is viewed as a sign of intelligence for understanding and reacting to the unforeseen changes in order to retain their normal functionalities. The resilient behavior within the livings is developed through an evolutionary cycle. Here, we want to provide an enterprise network (EN) with a resilient behavior by embedding intelligent formulations to guide EN through uncertain workload, which is not considered during early design stage. We formulated the resilient management problem within EN as an optimization problem, with an objective function is to maximize the resilience. We developed a bio-inspired tool comprising of Genetic Algorithm (GA), Molecular Assembly (MA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Our experimental results on an EN of 100 nodes, with a heavy backbone traffic of 7.6 TB demonstrated that GA gains the maximum resilience of 50%, whereas MA gains 46%, ACO gains 31.54%, and the original EN had 20% resilience. However, with light workload, MA and GA performed closely with a maximum resilience of 64% and 62%, respectively, and ACO showed a moderate resilience with a maximum of 32%."

2018,A characterization of types of support between structured arguments and their relationship with support in abstract argumentation,"Cohen, A; Parsons, S; Sklar, EI; McBurney, P","Argumentation is an important approach in artificial intelligence and multiagent systems, providing a basis for single agents to make rational decisions, and for groups of agents to reach agreements, as well as a mechanism to underpin a wide range of agent interactions. In such work, a crucial role is played by the notion of attack between arguments, and the notion of attack is well-studied. There is, for example, a range of different approaches to identifying which of a set of arguments should be accepted given the attacks between them. Less well studied is the notion of support between arguments, yet the idea that one argument may support another is very intuitive and seems particularly relevant in the area of decision-making where decision options may have multiple arguments for and against them. In the last decade, the study of support in argumentation has regained attention among researchers, but most approaches address support in the context of abstract argumentation where the elements from which arguments are composed are ignored. In contrast, this paper studies the notion of support between arguments in the context of structured argumentation systems where the elements from which arguments are composed play a crucial role. Different forms of support are presented, each of which takes into account the structure of arguments; and the relationships between these forms of support are studied. Then, the paper investigates whether there is a correspondence between the structured and abstract forms of support, and determines whether the abstract formalisms may be instantiated using concrete forms of support in terms of structured arguments. The conclusion is that support in structured argumentation does not mesh well with support in abstract argumentation, and this suggests that more work is required to develop forms of support in abstract argumentation that model what happens in structured argumentation.

2018,A Closed Loop Inverse Kinematics Solver Intended for Offline Calculation Optimized with GA,"Bjoerlykhaug, ED","This paper presents a simple approach to building a robotic control system. Instead of a conventional control system which solves the inverse kinematics in real-time as the robot moves, an alternative approach where the inverse kinematics is calculated ahead of time is presented. This approach reduces the complexity and code necessary for the control system. Robot control systems are usually implemented in low level programming language. This new approach enables the use of high level programming for the complex inverse kinematics problem. For our approach, we implement a program to solve the inverse kinematics, called the Inverse Kinematics Solver (IKS), in Java, with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to load a file with desired end effector poses and edit the configuration of the robot using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention. The program uses the closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) algorithm to solve the inverse kinematics problem. As an example, the IKS was set up to solve the kinematics for a custom built serial link robot. The kinematics for the custom robot is presented, and an example of input and output files is also presented. Additionally, the gain of the loop in the IKS is optimized using a GA, resulting in almost a 50% decrease in computational time."

2018,A comparative study on parameters of leaf-shaped patch antenna using hybrid artificial intelligence network models,"Ozkaya, U; Seyfi, L","This study proposes a very compact coaxial-fed planar antenna for X band applications. The antenna design includes a tulip-shaped radiator on the FR4 dielectric substrate. The antenna parameters, such as return losses, bandwidth and operating frequency, have close relationships with patch geometry. In order to obtain desired antenna parameters for X band application, patch dimension is necessary to be optimized. In this article, four different hybrid artificial intelligence network models are suggested for optimization. These are particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, grey wolf optimizer and vortex search algorithm. Also, they are combined with artificial neural network for the purpose of estimating dimension of patch. Therefore, the comparison of different proposed algorithms is analyzed to obtain higher characteristics for antenna design. Their results are compared with each other in HFSS 13.0 software. The antenna with the most suitable return loss, bandwidth and operating frequency is selected to be used in antenna design."
2018,A comparison of performance of several artificial intelligence methods for predicting the dynamic viscosity of TiOC2/SAE 50 nano-lubricant,"Esfe, MH; Tatar, A; Ahangar, MRH; Rostamian, H","Since the conventional thermal fluids such as water, oil, and ethylene glycol have poor thermal properties, the tiny solid particles are added to these fluids to increase their heat transfer improvement. As viscosity determines the rheological behavior of a fluid, studying the parameters affecting the viscosity is crucial. Since the experimental measurement of viscosity is expensive and time consuming, predicting this parameter is the apt method. In this work, three artificial intelligence methods containing Genetic Algorithm-Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (GA-RBF), Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) were applied to predict the viscosity of TiOC2/SAE 50 nano-lubricant with Non-Newtonian power-law behavior using experimental data. The correlation factor (R-2), Average Absolute Relative Deviation (AARD), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Margin of Deviation were employed to investigate the accuracy of the proposed models. RMSE values of 0.58, 1.28, and 6.59 and R-2 values of 0.99998, 0.99991, and 0.99777 reveal the accuracy of the proposed models for respective GA-RBF, CSA-LSSVM, and GEP methods. Among the developed models, the GA-RBF shows the best accuracy."
2018,A Creativity Support System Based on Causal Mapping,"Oliveira, FS","Theory development is a very complex process that requires creativity and highly specialized analytical skills. This article presents a new algorithm, based on causal mapping, for assisting in the creation of qualitative theories. This algorithm is able to conjecture and prove new theorems, to test for consistency and completeness of the theory, and to derive meta-theorems comparing the different concepts in it. The use of the algorithm is exemplified in developing a theory to explain structural inertia in organizations."

This paper presents a critical analysis of the current approaches to mobility management by evaluating them against a set of criteria which are essentially inherent characteristics of such systems on which these approaches are expected to provide acceptable performance. We summarize these characteristics by using a quadruple set of metrics. Additionally, using this set we classify the various approaches to mobility management that are discussed in this paper. Finally, the paper concludes by reviewing the main findings and providing suggestions that will be helpful to guide future research efforts in the area."
2018,A critical review and analysis on techniques of speech recognition: The road ahead,"Haridas, AV; Marimuthu, R; Sivakumar, VG","Recognition of human speech has long been an intriguing issue among artificial intelligence and processing researchers. Speech is the most crucial and essential method of communication among the human beings. Several research efforts have been prepared in the field of speech recognition in the previous decades. Accordingly, a survey of speech recognition strategies suitable for human identification is discussed in this study. The main motivation of this survey is to explore the existing speech recognition strategies so that the researchers can include all the necessary metrics in their works in this domain and the limitations in the existing ones can be overcome. In this review, diverse issues included in speech recognition methodologies is distinguished and distinctive speech recognition procedures were studied to discover which qualities is tended to in a given system and which is disregarded. Hence, we offer a detailed survey of 50 methods from standard publishers from the year of 2000 to 2015. Here, we categorize the research based on three dissimilar perspectives, like techniques utilized, applications and parameter measures. In addition, this study gives an elaborate idea about speech recognition techniques."
2018,A Data-Driven Knowledge Acquisition System: An End-to-End Knowledge Engineering Process for Generating Production Rules,"Ali, M; Ali, R; Khan, WA; Han, SC; Bang, J; Hur, T; Kim, D; Lee, S; Kang, BH","Data-driven knowledge acquisition is one of the key research fields in data mining. Dealing with large amounts of data has received a lot of attention in the field recently, and a number of methodologies have been proposed to extract insights from data in an automated or semi-automated manner. However, these methodologies generally target a specific aspect of the data mining process, such as data acquisition, data preprocessing, or data classification. However, a comprehensive knowledge acquisition method is crucial to support the end-to-end knowledge engineering process. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge acquisition system that covers all major phases of the cross-industry standard process for data mining. Acknowledging the importance of an end-to-end knowledge engineering process, we designed and developed an easy-to-use data-driven knowledge acquisition tool (DDKAT). The major features of the DDKAT are: (1) a novel unified features scoring approach for data selection; (2) a user-friendly data processing interface to improve the quality of the raw data; (3) an appropriate decision tree algorithm selection approach to build a classification model; and (4) the generation of production rules from various decision tree classification models in an automated manner. Furthermore, two diabetes studies were performed to assess the value of the DDKAT in terms of user experience. A total of 19 experts were involved in the first study and 102 students in the artificial intelligence domain were involved in the second study. The results showed that the overall user experience of the DDKAT was positive in terms of its attractiveness, as well as its pragmatic and hedonic quality factors."
2018,A data-driven model based on Fourier transform and support vector regression for monthly reservoir inflow forecasting,"Yu, X; Zhang, XQ; Qin, H","The recent trend for data-driven streamflow forecasting is to hybridize artificial intelligence with decomposition pre-processing. In this paper, a decomposition-based data-driven model called FT-SVR that exploits both Fourier transform (FT) and support vector regression (SVR) techniques is proposed for monthly reservoir inflow forecasting and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) located on the Yangtze River in China is taken as the case for study. As the inflow time series contains oscillations of disparate scales, FT-SVR uses FT to appropriately decompose the series into multiple decomposed components, with each component comprising of neighboring frequencies and having a clear physical meaning. SVR is employed to develop an independent forecasting model for each decomposed component. The development of each SVR model involves data normalization, input selection based on autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function analysis, and parameter calibration by a metaheuristic. FT-SVR is compared with three other models which are the same with FT-SVR except that one uses ensemble empirical mode decomposition, one uses singular spectrum analysis for decomposition, and the other one performs no decomposition. Experimental results demonstrate that FT-SVR is able to give almost perfect monthly inflow forecasting for the TGD and significantly outperforms the three other models, in terms of evaluation criteria including root mean squared error, correlation coefficient, mean average percentage error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, and relative error of maximum/minimum monthly inflow."
2018,A Decision Model Based on a GRASP Genetic Algorithm for Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem,"Yahyaoui, H; Krichen, S; Dekdouk, A","In this paper, the authors address a delivery process with time requirements in the supply chain, stated as follows: orders launched from customers are centralized and assigned to firms' depots for the delivery process. The consideration of a depot and a set of customers belonging to different firms, is seen as a VRPTW that serves n customers using a subset of vehicles. Implemented in this article is a DSS that handles the delivering activity in the supply chain. The DSS embeds a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and Genetic components for generating promising solutions in a concurrently run time. Simulation results are conducted on Solomon's benchmarks. The DSS records very competitive results regarding state-of-the-art approaches."
2018,A Deep Learning Approach to Digitally Stain Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Optic Nerve Head,"Devalla, SK; Chin, KS; Mari, JM; Tun, TA; Strouthidis, NG; Aung, T; Thiery, AH; Girard, MJA","PURPOSE. To develop a deep learning approach to digitally stain optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the optic nerve head (ONH). METHODS. A horizontal B-scan was acquired through the center of the ONH using OCT (Spectralis) for one eye of each of 100 subjects (40 healthy and 60 glaucoma). All images were enhanced using adaptive compensation. A custom deep learning network was then designed and trained with the compensated images to digitally stain (i.e., highlight) six tissue layers of the ONH. The accuracy of our algorithm was assessed (against manual segmentations) using the dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, intersection over union (IU), and accuracy. We studied the effect of compensation, number of training images, and performance comparison between glaucoma and healthy subjects. RESULTS. For images it had not yet assessed, our algorithm was able to digitally stain the retinal nerve fiber layer + prelamina, the RPE, all other retinal layers, the choroid, and the peripapillary sclera and lamina cribrosa. For all tissues, the dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, IU, and accuracy (mean) were 0.84 +/- 0.03, 0.92 +/- 0.03, 0.99 +/- 0.00, 0.89 +/- 0.03, and 0.94 +/- 0.02, respectively. Our algorithm performed significantly better when compensated images were used for training (P < 0.001). Besides offering a good reliability, digital staining also performed well on OCT images of both glaucoma and healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS. Our deep learning algorithm can simultaneously stain the neural and connective tissues of the ONH, offering a framework to automatically measure multiple key structural parameters of the ONH that may be critical to improve glaucoma management."
2018,A Distributed Snapshot Protocol for Efficient Artificial Intelligence Computation in Cloud Computing Environments,"Lim, J; Gil, JM; Yu, H","Many artificial intelligence applications often require a huge amount of computing resources. As a result, cloud computing adoption rates are increasing in the artificial intelligence field. To support the demand for artificial intelligence applications and guarantee the service level agreement, cloud computing should provide not only computing resources but also fundamental mechanisms for efficient computing. In this regard, a snapshot protocol has been used to create a consistent snapshot of the global state in cloud computing environments. However, the existing snapshot protocols are not optimized in the context of artificial intelligence applications, where large-scale iterative computation is the norm. In this paper, we present a distributed snapshot protocol for efficient artificial intelligence computation in cloud computing environments. The proposed snapshot protocol is based on a distributed algorithm to run interconnected multiple nodes in a scalable fashion. Our snapshot protocol is able to deal with artificial intelligence applications, in which a large number of computing nodes are running. We reveal that our distributed snapshot protocol guarantees the correctness, safety, and liveness conditions."
2018,A Dynamic Three-way Decision Model based on the Updating of Attribute Values,"Zhang, QH; Lv, GX; Chen, YH; Wang, GY","The three-way decision model is a topic of substantial research interest in the field of artificial intelligence, and many researchers have focused on to its feasibility and rationality. The tolerance and practicability of the three-way decision model are better than those of the two-way decision model. When the attribute value of each object in a domain is given, the formation of a three-way classification of the domain is a key issue. However, few studies have been conducted on establishing a three-way decision model with the given attribute values in the case where the number of objects in an accepted region is given. Therefore, in the model presented in this paper, both the uncertainty of attribute values and the cost of updating are fully considered. In this paper, first, a new concept of attribute ratio is defined to describe an object when the attribute value of the object is numerical, and then, a dynamic three-way decision model is established. Second, a feature extraction algorithm of attribute values is proposed, and a pair of decision thresholds of the dynamic three-way decision model is also obtained according to the given conditions. Then, in the case where the attribute values are updated, an example is provided to demonstrate how two-way classification results can be obtained in the dynamic decision-making process. Finally, the results of simulation experiments show that the proposed model is feasible and effective in practical applications. When the number of objects in an accepted region has been given, according to the updating strategy of attribute values, the three-way decision problems are successfully solved by the proposed model.

2018,A fuzzy logic navigation controller implemented in hardware for an electric wheelchair,"Rojas, M; Ponce, P; Molina, A","In this article, we present an obstacle avoidance controller implemented in a field programmable gate array for an electric wheelchair. It is based on a traditional approach with ultrasonic sensors and fuzzy logic. Various tests were conducted to characterize the prototype and to evaluate the controller performance. The results showed that the system is able to acquire data from sensors and make decisions 46.16 times per second. The sensors' coverage extends 3 m to the front, rear, left, and right sides of the wheelchair; moreover, the sensors detect 0.95-cm diameter objects at 40 cm. The power consumption was evaluated, and it was found that the hardware architecture reduces the battery life by only 0.87%.

The proposed methodology uses data from eight sonars distributed around the wheelchair to make navigation decisions, besides the hardware-based architecture guarantees real-time control and on-time response."
2018,A Fuzzy-Based Building Energy Management System for Energy Efficiency,"Hernandez, JL; Sanz, R; Corredera, A; Palomar, R; Lacave, I","Information and communication technologies (ICT) offer immense potential to improve the energetic performance of buildings. Additionally, common building control systems are typically based on simple decision-making tools, which possess the ability to obtain controllable parameters for indoor temperatures. Nevertheless, the accuracy of such common building control systems is improvable with the integration of advanced decision-making techniques embedded into software and energy management tools. This paper presents the design of a building energy management system (BEMS), which is currently under development, and that makes use of artificial intelligence for the automated decision-making process required for optimal comfort of occupants and utilization of renewables for achieving energy-efficiency in buildings. The research falls under the scope of the H2020 project BREASER which implements fuzzy logic with the aim of governing the energy resources of a school in Turkey, which has been renovated with a ventilated facade with integrated renewable energy sources (RES). The BRESAER BEMS includes prediction techniques that increase the accuracy of common BEMS tools, and subsequent energy savings, while ensuring the indoor thermal comfort of the building occupants. In particular, weather forecast and simulation strategies are integrated into the functionalities of the overall system. By collecting the aforementioned information, the BEMS makes decisions according to a well-established selection of key performance indicators (KPIs) with the objective of providing a quantitative comparable value to determine new actuation parameters."
2017,A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs,"George, D; Lehrach, W; Kansky, K; Lazaro-Gredilla, M; Laan, C; Marthi, B; Lou, XH; Meng, ZS; Liu, Y; Wang, HY; Lavin, A; Phoenix, DS","Learning from a few examples and generalizing to markedly different situations are capabilities of human visual intelligence that are yet to be matched by leading machine learning models. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, we introduce a probabilistic generative model for vision in which message-passing-based inference handles recognition, segmentation, and reasoning in a unified way. The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our model emphasizes aspects such as data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial intelligence."
2018,A Hermite neural network incorporating artificial bee colony optimization to model shoreline realignment at a reef-fronted beach,"Tsekouras, GE; Trygonis, V; Maniatopoulos, A; Rigos, A; Chatzipavlis, A; Tsimikas, J; Mitianoudis, N; Velegrakis, AF","This paper investigates the potential of using a novel Hermite polynomial neural network to model shoreline realignment along an urban beach fronted by a highly irregular beachrock reef. Modeling takes place on the basis of a number of input variables related to reef morphology and wave forcing, whereas the output variable is time series of shoreline position that have been recorded in high spatio-temporal resolution using a coastal video monitoring system. The main network functionality is the generation of Hermite truncated polynomial series of linear combinations of the input variables, and output is calculated as the weighted sum of these truncated series. It is shown that the proposed network can approximate any continuous function defined on a compact set of the multidimensional Euclidean space to arbitrary accuracy. The network is optimized in terms of a modified artificial bee colony method. For comparative reasons, three more related neural networks have been tested that have been optimized by employing different swarm intelligence-based algorithms. Comparison between the four networks has been carried out by standard performance criteria and detailed parametric statistical analysis. Main results of the study are: (a) polynomial orders 3 and 4 are able to effectively handle reasonably well the high nonlinear effects imposed by the presence of the reef; (b) the statistical analysis indicates that the proposed network outperforms the other networks tested; and (c) model efficiency improves noticeably when beach sections behind reef inlets and/or particular wide sections of the reef that introduce high shoreline variability are not considered.

2018,A High Precision Artificial Neural Networks Model for Short-Term Energy Load Forecasting,"Kuo, PH; Huang, CJ","One of the most important research topics in smart grid technology is load forecasting, because accuracy of load forecasting highly influences reliability of the smart grid systems. In the past, load forecasting was obtained by traditional analysis techniques such as time series analysis and linear regression. Since the load forecast focuses on aggregated electricity consumption patterns, researchers have recently integrated deep learning approaches with machine learning techniques. In this study, an accurate deep neural network algorithm for short-term load forecasting (STLF) is introduced. The forecasting performance of proposed algorithm is compared with performances of five artificial intelligence algorithms that are commonly used in load forecasting. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Cumulative Variation of Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE) are used as accuracy evaluation indexes. The experiment results show that MAPE and CV-RMSE of proposed algorithm are 9.77% and 11.66%, respectively, displaying very high forecasting accuracy."

The study aims to forecast and compare the performance of two non-linear artificial intelligence approaches in predicting the number of tourist arrivals to Singapore. The Singapore inbound monthly tourism data were utilized to generate one, two, four and six month ahead forecasts with non-linear autoregressive (NAR) neural networks and neuro-fuzzy systems. The predictive accuracy of NAR neural networks and neuro-fuzzy systems were compared with various performance metrics. The study revealed that neuro-fuzzy systems outperformed NAR networks in all forecasting horizons and for all countries. The proposed neuro-fuzzy methodology helps in improving the forecasting performance of artificial intelligence based techniques. The study contributes to hospitality literature and could be utilized by managers to effectively plan and implement tourism related policy measures."
